\section{Abstraction Levels}
The purpose of using different abstraction levels is to hide details which are not essential for the current view of the problem. Information that is not important is hidden in higher levels of abstraction. The different abstraction levels of HDLs are shown in figure \ref{fig:hdlabstractionlevels}.

\subsection{Behavioural Level}
The behavioural level describes the behaviour of a system, regarding to its input-output relationships.\cite{Hartenstein1987}. The system is shown defining concurrent algorithms, where each of them is in a sequential manner. The behavioural level is often used to model complete systems. Also stimuli for the RTL-level are described in that level. A point to mention is the fact, that no system clock is defined and signal transitions are asynchronous with respect to the switching time.\\
It must be pointed out, that hardware descriptions in the behavioural level are simulateable, but usually not synthesizable. This means that no hardware manufacturing process can be done using only that description.\cite{Ver16}
\subsection{Register-Transfer Level}
One step down from the behavioural level the register-transfer level is used. The system complexity is broken down to combinational logic and storage elements like registers. The transfer of data between registers is defined. An explicit clock is defined, and transitions only occur in defined clock cycles. Furthermore storage elements (flip-flops) are controlled by clock cycles. The RTL is fully synthesizable.\cite{Ver16}\cite{Asic14}
\subsection{Logical Level}
The logical level, sometimes also called gate level, represents the system as netlist with storage elements and logic gates (AND, NOR, ...). The representation is done using logical links with technology-specific timing properties. Signals have only discrete logical values. In most cases the generation fo the gate netlist is done using automated synthesis tools.
\subsection{Layout Level}
To fabricate the design to a physical chip the logic level model has to be transferred to a physical model, where the exact geometric placement and the topology placement of the system has to be defined. During this process every gate and storage element is transferred to layers of metal, silicon, contacts etc.\cite{Cey96} In this level the length of wires connecting the gates can be converted proportional to propagation delays. This should be considerated for timing issues according to the clock rate.
