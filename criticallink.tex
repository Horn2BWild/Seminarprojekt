\subsection{I$^2$C}
The I$^2$C-bus was intentionally developed by Philips in the early 1980s to exchange information between ICs located on the same board. This bus is designed for synchronous transmission and is built up of ground, data and clock line. As advantage of this protocol the clock reconstruction possibilities at the receiver has to be mentioned. Furthermore an arbitrary protocol guarantees that only one master exists at one time. I$^2$C defines communication modes as follows:

More information can be found in the I$^2$C-specification in \cite{I2Cspec}.
